## üìå Project Overview
</div>
The aim of this project is to develop a Real-time detection of empty parking spots using AI and computer vision to improve parking efficiency. 

This is accomplished by:
- **Collecting Images**
- **Training a model**
- **Evaluating with SVM Classifier**
- **Generating side-by-side comparisons for visual verification**

## üîç Key Features

</div>

- **Real-Time Parking Spot Detection**: Analyzes Video footage to identify empty parking spaces live
- **AI-Powered Accuracy with Machine Learning & Computer Vision**:Employs machine learning models and visual processing to reliably distinguish between occupied and empty spaces.
- **Model Flexibility**: Supports switching between baseline (CNN) and advanced models (e.g., ESPCN).
- **Performance Evaluation**: Automated calculation of PSNR, SSIM, and visual results.

## üß† Technologies Used

</div>

### Machine Learning Frameworks
- **PyTorch** or **TensorFlow** (configurable)
- **OpenCV / Pillow** for image processing
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Scikit-learn** for substract the mean value of first image pixels with second image pixels
 and The output shows how similar two images are or how different two images are from each other


### Development Tools
- Python 3.9+
- Git & GitHub for version control
- Jupyter Notebooks for result visualization
